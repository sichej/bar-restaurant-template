# bar-restaurant-template

This is a template I coded to help other users to create a simple menu for their bar or restaurant.\
In the `js/menu.js` you can find the example I used for one of my friend's bar [The Cups](https://festive-brown-49c133.netlify.app).

## HTML structure

Each part of the menu is structurated like this:
```html
<!-- Salad -->
<div class="title-middle">
    <p><strong>Le Nostre Insalate:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="menu-viewer" id="menu-salad">
    <!-- menu salad-->
</div>
```
The first div is for the title of the menu's section and the second div is where the HTML code generated by the `js/menu.js` is going to be put.
